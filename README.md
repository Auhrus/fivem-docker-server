# FiveM Docker Server ü¶∫

This image provides a FiveM/txAdmin server. After the first startup, it downloads the defined version from the CFX servers. If there is an update to the server files, simply recreate the container without having to redownload the image again. Everything will be downloaded again (only new) and you can continue.

## Environment Variablesüî¢

To run this container, you will need to set the following environment variables.

| Variable      | Function      | Default |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------|
| `download`    |With this variable you can determine which version of the FiveM server will be downloaded.<br>Below you will find a more detailed description of this variable.|recommended|
| `PATH`    |You can ignore this, it will be created automatically by the Alpine base.|/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:<br>/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin|


#### Detailed description of the `download` variable
There are 3 ways to use the variable.<br>
1. Set it to 'recommended'<br>
	In that case, the version that can be downloaded at the time of container creation via the "Latest Recommended" button. Seen in the picture below.<br>
 
2. Set it to 'optional'<br>
	In that case, the version that can be downloaded at the time of container creation via the "Latest Optional" button. Seen in the picture below.<br>
 
3. or insert a link of the desired version<br>
   	If you need a specific version of the server, you can also insert the direct link to the desired version file. The link will look like this e.g.<br>
    
```html
https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build_proot_linux/master/6622-d24291cd0e6119311f5b410be6167f6ccdc3e62d/fx.tar.xz

--library-path "$SCRIPTPATH/alpine/usr/lib/v8/:$SCRIPTPATH/alpine/lib/:$SCRIPTPATH/alpine/usr/lib/" -- \

## Up-/Downgrade‚è´

How do i change the version of my FiveM Server?

1. First stop and remove the existing Container.
```bash
docker stop CONAINER_NAME && docker rm CONAINER_NAME
```
2. Then create him again like in the [Deploymentüë©‚Äçüíª](https://github.com/Auhrus/fivem-docker-server#deployment) with the same Volumes.

**Please note** that downgrading may cause compatibility problems e.g. with the txAdmin database.
