# FiveM Docker Server

This image provides a FiveM/txAdmin server. After the first start it downloads the necessary files from the Steam servers. If there is an update to the server files, simply recreate the container without having to re-download the image. It will download everything again (just in new) and you can continue.

## Deployment👩‍💻

How to install this Docker Container

1. Install Docker on your Server. Here you can find a guide [[here]](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=How+to+install+Docker+on+Ubuntu)
2. Run that command
```bash
docker run --name CONAINER_NAME -p 7777-7778:7777-7778/tcp -p 8888:8888/tcp -p 10000:10000/tcp -p 7777-7778:7777-7778/udp -v VOLUME_NAME:/home/steam/theisle-dedicated/TheIsle/Saved/Config/LinuxServer -v VOLUME_NAME:/home/steam/theisle-dedicated/TheIsle/Saved/PlayerData ghcr.io/auhrus/theisle-evrima-docker-server:latest
```
Please replace all things written in CAPS.

3. After all data has been downloaded, restart the container.
```bash
docker restart CONAINER_NAME
```
4. After that the TheIsle server starts again it generates the save files, etc.


## IMPORTANT‼️
-Make sure that the folder of the volumes for the configs and the playerdata have the owner and group 1000:1000.

-The server does not create the .ini files itself, they must be created manually on the volume. The "basic-configs" folder contains the minimum configuration requirements for starting the server.
